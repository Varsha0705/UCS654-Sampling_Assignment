# Sampling Assignment - Machine Learning Models and Sampling Techniques

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates the application of five **sampling techniques** and evaluates their impact on the performance of five **machine learning models**. The assignment involves creating balanced datasets using various sampling techniques, applying these datasets to ML models, and comparing their accuracies.

---

## **Steps Completed**

### **1. Dataset**
The dataset used is `Creditcard_data.csv`, containing features for binary classification (`Class` column).

### **2. Sampling Techniques**
Five sampling techniques were applied to create balanced datasets:
1. **Sampling1**: Random Sampling
2. **Sampling2**: Systematic Sampling
3. **Sampling3**: Cluster Sampling
4. **Sampling4**: Stratified Sampling
5. **Sampling5**: Oversampling

Each sampling technique was applied to generate balanced datasets and ensure fair model evaluation.

---

### **3. Models**
Five machine learning models were used to evaluate each sampled dataset:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
3. **Random Forest Classifier**
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

---

### **4. Accuracy Matrix**
The models were trained and evaluated on the five sampling techniques, and their accuracy was stored in the following matrix:

| Model | Sampling1 | Sampling2 | Sampling3 | Sampling4 | Sampling5 |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| M1 (Logistic Regression) | 0.9836 | 0.8525 | 0.8852 | 0.9344 | 0.9180 |
| M2 (Decision Tree)        | 0.8689 | 0.9672 | 0.9508 | 0.9672 | 0.9508 |
| M3 (Random Forest)        | 0.9672 | 1.0000 | 0.9836 | 0.9836 | 0.9836 |
| M4 (SVM)                  | 0.7377 | 0.5902 | 0.7213 | 0.6721 | 0.6885 |
| M5 (KNN)                  | 0.7377 | 0.7213 | 0.7541 | 0.7377 | 0.6721 |
